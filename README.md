# ![Paragraphs](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/paragraphs/blob/1.x-1.x/images/paragraphs.png "Paragraphs for BackdropCMS")

Paragraph is a module to create paragraphs in your content.
You can create bundles (with their own display and fields) as paragraph types.

When you add a paragraph field to your node/entity, you can select the allowed 
bundles, and when using the field, you can select a paragraph type from the 
allowed bundles to use different fields/display per paragraph.
